## About me

Hello and welcome to my website. I am an engineering student who also likes to work on software projets.  
My main fields of interest are:

- 3D printing (mainly FDM but also some SLA and metal based processes)
- Deep learning (mainly object detection)
- robotics
- Making and maker culture in general

What i really love is working on projects that span over multiple fields (like mechanics, electronics, informatics, ...) and push the limits of what is possible by doing so.
